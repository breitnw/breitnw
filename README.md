Hey, I'm Nick! I'm a 3rd-year CS student at Northwestern University, and I'm a big fan of silly gadgets, dumb software, and functional programming.

Here are some things I've made that you can take a look at:

- [rhyolite](https://github.com/breitnw/rhyolite-fluids), my Rust/Vulkan rendering engine
- [micromusic](https://github.com/breitnw/micromusic), my Apple Music miniplayer
- [mndco11age.xyz](https://mndco11age.xyz), my personal website

There's plenty of other stuff too if you wanna check it out. Thanks for dropping by :)
