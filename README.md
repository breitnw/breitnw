Hey! I'm a senior at Northwestern researching [programming language pragmatics](https://cacm.acm.org/research/the-rational-programmer-investigating-programming-language-pragmatics/). I'm a big fan of beautiful abstractions and human-made software.

Here are some cool things I've made:

- [rhyolite](https://github.com/breitnw/rhyolite-fluids), my Vulkan rendering engine
- [micromusic](https://github.com/breitnw/micromusic), my Apple Music miniplayer
- [mndco11age.xyz](https://mndco11age.xyz), my personal website

And here are some of the might-be-cool-if-you're-into-it, research-y things I've worked on:

- [stlc-termination](https://github.com/breitnw/stlc-termination), my proof of termination for the simply-typed lambda calculus
- [trace-contracts-324](https://github.com/breitnw/trace-contracts-324), an operational-semantics model of trace contracts built in [PLT Redex](https://redex.racket-lang.org/)
- [r-compile-server](https://github.com/PRL-PRG/r-compile-server), a just-in-time compilation infrastructure for R
  
Please note that I will never accept PRs with commits made by GenAI agents. Your code is much better when you write it! Believe in yourself!
